          One of the best snowboarding games on any platform, 1080 Snowboarding
          faithfully recreates the mountain experience with beautiful graphics,
          realistic character and environment physics, atmospheric sound
          effects, and addictive gameplay. Players compete on a variety of
          unique tracks ranging from a half-pipe and long jump--both devoted to
          trick-happy boarders--to long descents that offer plenty of
          environmental obstacles, including jumps, deep powder, ice, and thick
          stands of trees. On several tracks, simply reaching the bottom of the
          hill is an accomplishment in itself.;

          AeroGauge is a futuristic racing game that blasts you through six
          futuristic courses at nearly 1,000 miles per hour. Choose one of 10
          high-speed Aeromachines and prepare to race from a default
          behind-the-ship viewpoint. Not only will you find yourself racing
          along the ground, but you can soar above courses as well, elevating
          over obstacles and past enemies to discover shortcuts. Since your
          craft suffers damage while racing, pit stops are available to
          replenish lost energy.

            "Blast Corps" is a Nintendo 64 classic developed by game developer
            "Rare" in the late '90s. This action-puzzle game gave you control
            over a wide variety of vehicles, allowing you to dramatically crash
            through buildings, bridging gaps, and wreaking havoc.

          Buck Bumble is a big game, no doubt about it. There are 20 missions of
          varying size and depth (some longer and more complicated, some shorter
          and time-reliant), but all of them are rather frustrating, with the
          exception of the boss levels, which can actually be quite challenging
          and fun. The gameplay is linear, so you work your way through each
          level by utilizing teleporters and destroying generators to open Herd
          Gates that lead to the next area you need to visit. The problem with
          the way the missions are set up is that your progress means little
          unless you finish the mission with just one life. You can save the
          game once a mission is completed and you do have three bees to beat
          the game with, however, if you die, you start at the beginning of the
          mission, and all of your progress is lost.

          California Speed might sound like the new trendy drug of choice for
          Hollywood's swanky celebs, but it's merely Midway's translation of the
          arcade racing game from Atari Games. Still, "drug" might not be a
          too-far-off description for this game: Although it gets you juiced up
          with psychedelic, tripped-out track designs, its shallow gameplay and
          dated graphics quickly bring you back down to a catatonic stupor.
          Those of you addicted to simple arcade racers may still feel a "rush,"
          but for the rest, this game's a bad trip.

          Konami's long-running Castlevania series is renowned for its chilling
          atmosphere, fantastic music, and, most importantly, superb 2D
          gameplay. Now, for the first time in its illustrious 13-year career,
          the series is making the jump into 3D - a jump that understandably has
          many fans feeling quite skeptical. Fortunately, the development team
          at KCE Kobe has done an excellent job of making the transition to 3D,
          while still staying true to the series' roots. While not quite the
          overall epic masterpiece that was Symphony of the Night on the
          PlayStation, N64 Castlevania provides an oddly compelling 3D
          vampire-hunting experience that fans of the series should definitely
          not miss.

          Mission: Impossible was considered a commercial success and sold more
          than one million copies as of February 1999. The game received mixed
          reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare's 1997 game
          GoldenEye 007. Although its varied levels and objectives received some
          praise, the game was generally criticized for its inconsistent
          gameplay and slow controls. A port of the game, with lighting effects,
          voice acting, and other minor improvements, was released for the
          PlayStation console in 1999.
